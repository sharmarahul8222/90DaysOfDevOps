Task 1: GitHub-Hosted Runners
- Create a workflow with 3 jobs, each on a different OS: (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest)
- In each job, print: OS name, runner's hostname, and the current user running the job

- Watch all 3 run in parallel

- Write in your notes: What is a GitHub-hosted runner? Who manages it?
  A GitHub-hosted runner is a virtual machine provided by GitHub that executes GitHub Actions workflows. When a workflow is triggered, GitHub automatically creates a temporary machine to run the job. And GitHub-hosted runners are fully managed by GitHub.


Task 2: Explore What's Pre-installed
- On the ubuntu-latest runner, run a step that prints: Docker version, Python version, Node version, Git version.

- Look up the GitHub docs for the full list of pre-installed software on ubuntu-latest
  You can find it [here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images)
  
- Write in your notes: Why does it matter that runners come with tools pre-installed?
  GitHub-hosted runners come with many commonly used development tools already installed. This is important for several reasons like Faster CI/CD Pipelines, Simple Workflow Configuration, Consistent Build Environment and Reduce Maintenance Effort.


Task 3: Set Up a Self-Hosted Runner
- Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
- Choose Linux as the OS
- Follow the instructions to download and configure the runner on:
- Your local machine, OR
- A cloud VM (EC2, Utho, or any VPS)
- Start the runner — verify it shows as Idle in GitHub
- Verify: Your runner appears in the Runners list with a green dot.

Task 4: Use Your Self-Hosted Runner
- Create .github/workflows/self-hosted.yml
- Set runs-on: self-hosted
- Add steps that:
  - Print the hostname of the machine (it should be YOUR machine/VM)
  - Print the working directory
  - Create a file and verify it exists on your machine after the run
- Trigger it and watch it run on your own hardware

- Verify: Check your machine — is the file there?

Task 5: Labels
- Add a label to your self-hosted runner (e.g., my-linux-runner)

- Update your workflow to use runs-on: [self-hosted, my-linux-runner]

- Trigger it — does it still pick up the job?

- What is Labels in GitHub Action?
  
Labels in a GitHub Actions runner are used to target specific runners for a job defined in a workflow file. They allow you to control which machine executes a particular job, especially in self-hosted environments.

- Why Are Labels Useful When You Have Multiple Self-Hosted Runners?
  
Labels become important when a project has multiple self-hosted runners with different capabilities.
They allow workflows to run on the correct machine based on requirements.


Task 6: GitHub-Hosted vs Self-Hosted
| Feature                 | GitHub-Hosted Runner                                                      | Self-Hosted Runner                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who manages it?**     | Managed completely by **GitHub**                                          | Managed by **you (user / organization)**                          |
| **Cost**                | Free for public repositories and limited minutes for private repos        | Cost of **your own infrastructure (VM, server, cloud instance)**  |
| **Pre-installed tools** | Comes with **many tools pre-installed** (Docker, Node, Python, Git, etc.) | You must **install and maintain tools yourself**                  |
| **Good for**            | Quick setup, CI pipelines, testing across multiple OS environments        | Custom environments, private networks, heavy workloads            |
| **Security concern**    | Runs on GitHub infrastructure (less control)                              | Runs on your infrastructure (more control but you must secure it) |
