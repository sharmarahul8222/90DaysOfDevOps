Task 1: Create Your First Pod (Nginx)
- Create a file called nginx-pod.yaml
  <img width="1033" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d37e8d6-7287-4541-8bdb-8e9f291e0114" />

- Apply it: kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml

- explore commands: kubectl get pods, kubectl get pods -o wide, kubectl describe pod nginx-pod

- explore commads: kubectl logs nginx-pod

- explore kubectl exec -it nginx-pod -- /bin/bash, curl localhost:80, exit

Task 2: Create a Custom Pod (BusyBox)
- Write a new manifest busybox-pod.yaml
  <img width="1096" height="298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/248674af-0df7-4171-b6ef-04865ecd9ecd" />
  
- Apply and verify: kubectl apply -f busybox-pod.yaml, kubectl get pods, kubectl logs busybox-pod

Task 3: Imperative vs Declarative

- Imperative: The Imperative approach is focused on the "How." You provide the cluster with a series of active commands (e.g., kubectl run or kubectl scale) to change its state. This is highly efficient for one-off tasks, rapid prototyping, or local debugging because it provides immediate feedback without the overhead of writing files. However, it lacks a "paper trail," making it difficult to audit or reproduce exactly what was done if the cluster fails.

- Declarative: The Declarative approach is focused on the "What." Instead of telling Kubernetes what to do, you define the Desired State in a YAML or JSON manifest and use kubectl apply. The system then works automatically to align the current state with your definition. This method is the foundation of modern DevOps and GitOps; because the manifests are stored in version control (like Git), you have a complete history of every change, making it the superior choice for production workloads and CI/CD pipelines.


- Create a pod without a YAML file and extract the YAML that Kubernetes generated

Task 4: Validate Before Applying
- Before applying a manifest, you can validate it, if the YAML is valid without actually creating the resource

- Validate against the cluster's API (server-side validation)

- Now intentionally break your YAML (remove the image field or add an invalid field) and run dry-run again. See what error you get.

Task 5: Pod Labels and Filtering
- List all pods with their labels

- Filter pods by label

- Add a label to an existing pod and verify it with kubectl get pods --show-labels
  <img width="1420" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c308cfb3-920b-4d5d-8263-fa8c61ae77a9" />

- Remove a label with kubectl label pod nginx-pod environment-

Task 6: Clean Up
- Delete all the pods you created:

- Verify everything is gone
