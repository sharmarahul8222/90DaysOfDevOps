You will create a 90-day personal DevOps learning plan that clearly defines:

What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

  -DevOps is a culture and set of practices that brings development and operations together to deliver software faster, more reliably, and at scale.
  Cloud Engineering is about designing, deploying, and managing applications using cloud platforms so systems are scalable, cost-efficient, and highly available.

Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

  -I’m starting this journey because modern software runs on the cloud, and DevOps is at the heart of how real-world systems are built and maintained. I want to move beyond theory and learn how production systems actually work — automation, CI/CD, containers, and reliability.
  
Where do you want to reach?

  -I want to be in the Top 1% DevOps Engineer in the world.
  
How you will stay consistent every single day?

  I’ll stay consistent by:
      - Learning in small but focused daily sessions
      - Sharing my progress publicly to stay accountable
      - Building hands-on projects instead of just watching tutorials
      - Trusting consistency over motivation
