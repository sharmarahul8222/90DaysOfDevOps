Task 1: Recall the Kubernetes Story
- Why was Kubernetes created? What problem does it solve that Docker alone cannot?
  Docker alone had limitations when applications started growing.
  - No automatic scaling
  - No self-healing (if container dies, it stays down)
  - No load balancing
  - Difficult to manage multiple containers across machines
  But Kubernetes was created to manage containers at scale and resolve all above problems

- Who created Kubernetes and what was it inspired by?
  Kubernetes was created by Google, inspired by Borg, to solve large-scale container management problems like scaling, self-healing, and orchestration.
  
- What does the name "Kubernetes" mean?
  The name means “helmsman,” symbolizing control over containerized systems.

Task 5: Explore Your Cluster
- See cluster info  with kubectl cluster-info
  <img width="1222" height="110" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31332067-6a7b-4f59-bdea-c295c8ee6a90" />
  
- List all nodes with kubectl get nodes
<img width="970" height="160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef10acb-9cf2-427f-a6e4-d954db4bfdb9" />

- Get detailed info about your node with kubectl describe node <node-name>

- List all namespaces with kubectl get namespaces
- <img width="952" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c3635ca-c573-47d5-a32b-9fefbb715187" />

- See ALL pods running in the cluster (across all namespaces) with kubectl get pods -A

- Look at the pods running in the kube-system namespace with kubectl get pods -n kube-system

- List all available contexts (clusters)

- See the full kubeconfig

- What is a kubeconfig? Where is it stored on your machine?
  A kubeconfig is a configuration file used by Kubernetes tools (like kubectl) to:
  - Connect to a Kubernetes cluster
  - Authenticate the user
  - Define cluster details (API server, certificates, etc.)
    
  A kubeconfig file has:
  - Clusters → info about Kubernetes clusters
  - Users → authentication details
  - Contexts → which user + cluster to use
